## Competitor Positioning (from BRAND_GUIDE.md)

### vs. Coupa
**One-liner**: "Coupa is broad BSM. Esker is deep AP/AR — faster ROI, 90-day PoV vs. 12-month implementation."
- Esker wins on: depth of AP/AR automation, implementation speed, ERP flexibility
- Coupa wins on: breadth of platform (spend management, procurement, treasury)

**One-liner**: "Ariba locks you into SAP. Esker connects to any ERP — SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Dynamics."
- Esker wins on: ERP-agnostic, modern UX, faster adoption, independent PoV
- Ariba wins on: deep SAP integration, upstream procurement

### vs. Status Quo (Manual Processes)
**One-liner**: "The question isn't whether Esker is better. It's what it costs you every quarter to keep doing it this way."
- Quantify: cost per invoice ($12-15 manual vs. $2-3 automated)
- Quantify: FTEs tied to data entry
- Quantify: DPO gap vs. peers = working capital left on table
- Quantify: error rates and compliance exposure
