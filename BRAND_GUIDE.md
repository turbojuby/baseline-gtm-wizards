## Baseline Payments Identity

**What we are:** Esker's go-to-market partner for financial automation solutions in North America.

**What we sell:** Supply-to-Pay (S2P) and Procure-to-Pay (P2P) automation powered by Esker's AI platform — invoice processing, payment orchestration, workflow automation, and strategic cash management.

**Deal size:** Mid-market enterprise.

**Sales methodology:** Challenger Sales — reframe the prospect's understanding of their own pain, teach them something they didn't know, and push them toward a solution they didn't realize they needed.

**Esker credentials:** Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for 8 consecutive years. GenAI-powered invoice processing. 90-day Proof of Value (not 12-month implementations).

## Voice & Tone

### Principles

**Confident, not arrogant.** We know Esker wins. We don't need to shout it. Let the data do the talking.

**Data-led, not feature-led.** Never lead with "Esker has AI-powered invoice processing." Lead with "$1.75M annual savings from reducing cost-per-invoice by 78%." Features are supporting evidence, not the headline.

**Concise, not verbose.** Every screen in a deck should be glanceable in 3 seconds. Bold key phrase + dim supporting text. No paragraphs. No filler sentences. If you can cut a word, cut it.

**Provocative, not aggressive.** Challenger Sales means reframing — "The $260M Question" is better than "You're Losing $260M." Make them think, don't make them defensive.

**Peer-anchored, not theoretical.** Always use real competitor or peer benchmarks. "Nike pays in 45 days. Adidas in 77. You pay in 23." is more powerful than "You could extend your DPO."

### Writing Rules

- **Headlines:** 3-8 words. Question or bold statement. Tight letter spacing (-2.5px).
- **Subtitles:** One sentence max. Explains the headline's implication.
- **Section labels:** 1-2 words, uppercase, letters spaced at 3px. Sets context without stealing attention.
- **Stat labels:** 2-4 words, uppercase. Describe what the number means.
- **Card descriptions:** One sentence. `<strong>Bold lead</strong>` + dim supporting clause.
- **CTA list items:** `<strong>Bold benefit</strong>` + one-line explanation. Three items max.
- **Meta text:** Confidential notice, date, audience. Always present.

### Formatting Patterns

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Dollar amounts | `$1.75M`, `$260M+`, `$9.4B` — always abbreviated with M/B |
| Percentages | `78%`, `100 bps` — no decimals unless necessary |
| Days | `23 days`, `45 days` — always include "days" |
| Ranges | `$142M–$260M`, `35–45 days` — use en dash |
| Time periods | `90-day`, `Q4 2024`, `FY2024` — standard abbreviations |

## Persona Messaging Matrix

| Persona | Pain Points | Key Metrics | Messaging Angle | Hook Style |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **CFO / VP Finance** | Cash flow visibility, working capital optimization, DPO lagging peers, SG&A pressure | DPO (days), working capital freed ($M), NPV of early pay vs extended terms | Financial impact and peer benchmarks. "Your competitors have already captured this." Frame AP as a strategic lever, not a cost center. | Peer DPO comparison bars, working capital gap quantification |
| **Controller** | Manual processes, high error rates, compliance/audit risk, month-end close delays | Cost per invoice ($), error rate (%), audit prep time (hours), close cycle (days) | Process efficiency and risk reduction. "What if your team spent zero hours on data entry?" Frame automation as control and accuracy, not replacement. | Before/after cost-per-invoice comparison, error rate reduction |
| **AP Manager** | Data entry volume, approval routing bottlenecks, vendor inquiry overload, team burnout | Processing time per invoice (min), touchless rate (%), vendor query volume, team capacity (FTEs) | Daily workflow transformation. "Your team handles 180K invoices a year — how many does AI handle?" Frame as team empowerment and capacity creation. | Invoice volume vs. team size, touchless rate benchmarks |
| **IT / CIO** | Integration complexity with existing ERP, maintenance burden, security concerns, vendor lock-in | Implementation time (days), API integration count, uptime (%), maintenance hours/month | Technical simplicity and ERP independence. "Connects to your ERP in weeks, not quarters." Frame as cloud-native, low-maintenance, ERP-agnostic. | Integration timeline comparison, architecture simplicity |

### Persona Selection

Default to **CFO / VP Finance** messaging unless the sales context indicates otherwise. If the meeting transcript mentions specific operational pain (e.g., invoice processing, AP team workload), shift to the relevant operational persona.

Teaser decks always target the financial decision-maker. Discovery decks can blend personas based on the expected audience.

## Competitor Positioning

### vs. Coupa

| Dimension | Coupa | Esker |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Focus | Broad BSM platform (spend management, procurement, treasury) | Specialist in S2P/P2P automation |
| AI | Coupa AI assistant (general) | GenAI invoice processing (trained on millions of documents) |
| Implementation | 6-12+ months typical | 90-day Proof of Value |
| ERP Integration | Coupa-centric data model | ERP-agnostic, native connectors for SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Dynamics |
| Strength | Breadth of platform | Depth of AP/AR automation, faster ROI |

**Talk track:** "Coupa is a great platform if you need everything in one place. But if your priority is AP automation that delivers ROI in 90 days — not 12 months — Esker's AI is purpose-built for this."

### vs. SAP Ariba

| Dimension | SAP Ariba | Esker |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| ERP lock-in | Optimized for SAP ERP | Works with any ERP |
| Buyer experience | Complex, enterprise-oriented UI | Modern UX, faster adoption |
| Procurement focus | Strong upstream procurement | Strong downstream S2P |
| Implementation | Tied to SAP project timelines | Independent 90-day PoV |

**Talk track:** "Ariba makes sense if you're all-in on SAP. But most companies have multi-ERP environments. Esker connects to whatever you run — SAP, Oracle, NetSuite — without locking you into one ecosystem."

### vs. Manual / Status Quo (The Real Competitor)

This is the most common competitor. The prospect is not evaluating Esker against another vendor — they are evaluating whether to do anything at all.

**Quantify the cost of doing nothing:**
- Cost per invoice (manual: $12-15, automated: $2-3)
- FTEs tied to manual processing
- DPO gap vs. peers = working capital left on the table
- Error rates and compliance exposure
- Opportunity cost of finance team on data entry vs. strategic work

**Talk track:** "The question isn't whether Esker is better than what you have. The question is: what does it cost you every quarter to keep doing it this way?"

## Content Rules

### Mandatory Elements

Every prospect-facing deck must include:
1. **Confidential notice** in hero meta: `Confidential · Prepared for [Company] Finance Leadership · [Month Year]`
2. **Source attribution** for all statistics: `Source: 10-K FY2024`, `Source: Ardent Partners 2024`, etc.
3. **Peer company comparisons** from the same industry and similar revenue band
4. **Real financial data** from public filings (10-K, 10-Q, earnings transcripts)
5. **Contact block** with Tyler's name and email

### Prohibited Elements

- **Pricing.** Never include pricing in any prospect-facing material. Pricing is locked in Airtable and disclosed in proposals only.
- **Feature lists.** Never lead with feature names. Lead with outcomes, quantified.
- **Generic claims.** No "best-in-class," "world-leading," or "cutting-edge" without a specific, sourced proof point.
- **Competitor bashing.** Position Esker's strengths, don't attack competitors by name in decks. Competitor positioning is for internal talk tracks and verbal conversations.
- **Internal process details.** No mention of Baseline's internal tools, agents, or automation in prospect-facing materials.

### Research Requirements

Before generating a teaser or discovery deck:
1. Pull the company's latest 10-K or annual report for financial metrics
2. Identify 2-3 peer companies in the same industry for DPO/working capital comparisons
3. Find recent earnings call quotes about AP/finance transformation priorities
4. Check for existing Esker case studies in the same industry vertical
5. Search the Notion Sales Wiki for any prior engagement context

### Tone Calibration by Deck Type

| Deck Type | Tone | Data Density | CTA Strength |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Teaser | Provocative, peer-anchored | 4-6 key stats | Soft ("Let's explore this together") |
| Discovery | Consultative, diagnostic | 8-12 detailed metrics | Medium ("Here's what we found") |
| Business Case | Analytical, ROI-focused | Full financial model | Strong ("The numbers speak for themselves") |
| ROI Calculator | Interactive, personalized | Dynamic inputs/outputs | Direct ("Based on your data, here's the impact") |
